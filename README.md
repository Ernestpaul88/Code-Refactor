# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## About the project

In this project, I reviewed the HTML and the CSS provided and applied best practices to make the code cleaner and more accessible.

I utilized semantic HTML elements and made sure the code is presented in a logical structure. The URL tabs in the header are able to jump to their corresponding sections. I added alt tags for broken images on the page. I've commented both the CSS and HTML source code. All the code is positioned correctly and displaying accurate information without breaking.

I've re-organized the CSS to display global, element, class, and used the ID selectors to easily identify groups. I removed redundant CSS and re-grouped a elements that use the same style structure. For example (All Benefit Images Display and Demensions ".benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img" All had the same CSS structure).

I am certain the HTML and CSS for this project is cleaner, more accessible and meets the acceptance criteria.
